Nearly every weekday afternoon Matilda was left alone in the 1house. Her brother 
(2five years older than her) went to school. Her father went to 3work and her 
mother went out playing 4bingo in a town 5eight miles away. Mrs Wormwood was 
hooked on 4bingo and 6played it five afternoons a week. On the afternoon of the 
day when her father had refused to buy her a 7book, Matilda set out all by 
herself to 8walk to the public library in the 9village. When she arrived, she 
introduced herself to the librarian, 10Mrs Phelps. She asked if she might 11sit 
awhile and read a book. 10Mrs Phelps, slightly taken aback at the arrival of such 
a 12tiny girl unaccompanied by a 13parent, nevertheless told her she was very 
14welcome.
